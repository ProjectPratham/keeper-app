 Utilizing React.js, HTML, CSS, and Material-UI, I've crafted a Google Keep clone. This dynamic application employs React components and hooks to replicate Google Keep's functionality. Users can create, edit, and delete notes with an intuitive and visually pleasing interface, mirroring the core features of the original Google Keep app.
